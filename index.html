			Chicken
		</div>
		<p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl. It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of more than 19 billion as of 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, more rarely, as pets.Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in Southeast Asia, East Asia and South Asia, but with the clade found in the Americas.BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's food safety watchdog urged member states on Thursday to monitor poultry products for the insecticide fipronil following the withdrawal of millions of chicken eggs from supermarket shelves last year.

The Parma-based EFSA tested some 5,500 samples of eggs and chicken meat between Sept. 1 and Nov. 30 of last year and found that about one in seven contained levels of fipronil exceeding the legal limit.

"It is recommended that fipronil and other acaricides be included in the future monitoring activities of the member states," EFSA said in a report.

Eight countries had submitted samples with elevated fipronil concentrations, including Italy, Germany and France, EFSA said.</p>
